# ScientificGames
Coding challenges that Scientific Games me gave to solve.

For the first problem, just type "make" and run ./alive <filename>
It will generate 100 (specified by a variable "num_persons") random
people born between 1900 and deceased before 2000, and find
the year with the most amount of people alive.
If you don't have a linux terminal available, check out the png output.

For the second problem, I just uploaded my code and exported MySql database.
The formView was for testing, I would submit values (as if I had just spun,
although letting me allow how much I won was a bit generous) which I then
in formRead, read from the values I input, got the player information from 
the database, validated the information, updated information and the database, 
and then generated a JSON response.

*note, if there is anything missing, or that I should redo, feel free to let
me know.
